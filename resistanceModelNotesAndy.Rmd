Notes on insecticide resistance model for liverpool.
andy south 27/1/15

My first go at keeping notes like this as an rmarkdown file.

**27/1/15**  7.5hrs

Editing `malaria_code_andy2.r`, indenting functions etc.

Much of the script from line 464 is setting up parameters for example runs.

input[a,b] : a=parameter number and b=scenario number

464         set input params
1058-2716   run model
2718        Actions needing full results.list (e.g. curtis plots use multiple scenarios) 

edited bookmarks to navigate around the file in RStudio.

**9/3/15** 4-5 1hr


**10/3/15** 4.15 -

```{r}
listFunctions <- function(filename) {
  temp.env <- new.env()
  sys.source(filename, envir = temp.env)
  functions <- lsf.str(envir=temp.env)
  rm(temp.env)
  return(functions)
}

listFunctions("malaria_code_andy.R")
```

So there are only 11 functions.

I can create an initial github repo for the files from Beth (&this notes file)
That means I will have version control for my initial restructuring. Later I may want to create a new repo for the reformatted code as a package.

What to call the first repo ? resistance

1. created repo on github
1. created RStudio project from github repo




### TO DO  

1. create a Github repo and just put my edited file from Beth in to start
1. create a readme.md file
1. ? create an RStudio project for the initial version
1. later, structure as R package, maybe move to a new github repo
