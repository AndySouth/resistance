A model to investigate the evolution of resistance to two insecticides used sequentially or in a mixture.

Andy South (@southmapr) and Ian Hastings [2018]

**To use**
* Select 'UI'  
* Modify inputs using the sliders for each scenario and insecticide
* Press the 'Run ...' buttons to replot either scenario 

The curves on the plots show the change in frequency of the allele giving resistance to insecticide1 (red) and insecticide2 (blue). A dashed line indicates use in a sequence and a solid line use in a mixture. If the allele frequencies are identical the curve appears purple. 

The inputs that can be changed are :

Model Input      | Description
------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------
1. Start Freq.  | starting frequency of this resistance allele in the population
2. Exposure | proportion of insects exposed to insecticide
3. Effectiveness | proportion of susceptible (SS) insects killed by exposure to insecticide
4. R. restoration  | Resistance restoration, ability of resistance (RR) to restore fitness of insects exposed to insecticide
5. Dominance of r. | Dominance of resistance, sets fitness of heterozygous (SR) insects between that of SS & RR in presence of insecticide
6. Cost  |  reduction in fitness of resistant (RR) insects in absence of insecticide
7. Dominance of cost  | sets fitness of heterozygous (SR) insects between that of SS & RR in absence of insecticide    


The research behind this model is described in a paper provisionally accepted to the Malaria Journal.
